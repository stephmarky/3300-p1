# Project 1: Factors of Happiness in European and Middle Eastern OECD Countries
## The Data
With an interest in variables that correlate with happiness, our team investigated the relationship of many, many different variables on happiness, from serious ones like GDP per capita to more interesting variables such as alcohol consumption. Ultimately, we decided to hone in on 4 variables - government health expenditure (international $ per person), tertiary education levels (of citizens aged 55-64), bureaucratic honesty (measured by the Corruptions Perceptions Index 2016 report), and antidepressant use (per 1000 people) - and for the sake of presentability and ability of our readers to process the data on a readable map size, we limited our scope to European and Middle Eastern OECD countries. Altogether, we searched through and combined 6 datasets into our single CSV for the countries we investigated, with each row representing the data for a new country and each column representing another datapoint. Any incomplete datasets were repaired with individually researched values (noted below). Our datasets comprised of:

1. 2017 World Happiness Report: Happiness Levels per Country (http://worldhappiness.report/ed/2017/) 
Gapminder (which was compiled from WHO global health expenditure database): Government health spending per person (international $) dataset (https://www.gapminder.org/data/)
2. Transparency International: 2016 Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) (https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016)
3. OECD: College Education of Older Citizens, Tertiary Education of Population Aged 55-64 (https://data.oecd.org/eduatt/population-with-tertiary-education.htm) - Dataset Repaired with http://www.oecd.org/education/Ireland-EAG2014-Country-Note.pdf for Ireland
4. OECD: Antidepressant Usage (http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/health-at-a-glance-2017/antidepressant-drugs-consumption-2000-and-2015-or-nearest-year_health_glance-2017-graph181-en) - Dataset Repaired with https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3686718/ for Ireland, Poland, and Switzerland
5. CIA World Factbook: Centroid of Country Geographic Coordinates (https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2011.html)

In addition, for our map of countries comes from the combination of the d3 equirectangular projection and the world-50m.json file used in class, and we used the svg viewbox function to hone in on our countries of interest. 

Furthermore, our icons came from copying and transforming paths from online svg files and deserve the following attributions:

## Visual Elements
We map our data onto 4 map plots and 1 summary plot, with a total of 3 major scales (a color scale for happiness on the map, a quartile scale for icon sizing for our 4 variables of interest on the map, and a linear scale for our 4 variables of interest on the circle plot).

Each of the 4 map plot selects a variable of interest (government health expenditure, bureaucratic honesty, college education rate, or antidepressant usage). Using a choropleth map with a color scale from red to yellow to green, with red countries being the least happy and green countries being the most happy, each country is colored on the map. Then for each country, in the coordinates determined by our CIA World Factbook dataset, we place an icon to match the variable of interest on the map plot. The sizing of the image is on a quartile scale, with the countries with the smallest value of our variable of interest receiving the smallest images. Since the data values are mapped into quartiles, we arbitrarily selected image sizes so a reader can easily see which quartile a certain country belongs to. Due to the legend being in a separate svg, images were resized such that those in the legend are the same size as those in the map. (We had initially implemented a linear scale for the data values which were fed into an area scale such that the area differences were proportional to the differences in our variable of interest; however, although some variables had high correlations with happiness, it wasn’t visible due to the lack of variance of image sizes, making it hard to see variable correlations. This linear scale and area scale infrastructure is still visible in the code, but has been modified instead to use the quartile scale.)

For the summary plot, we wanted to present the data so that all variables were visible in an intuitive and not overwhelming way. Each country is represented by a diamond within a labeled circle. The top vertex of the diamond extends upwards based on the country’s government healthcare spending. The right vertex of the diamond extends to the right based on the country’s bureaucratic honesty. The bottom vertex of the diamond extends downwards based on the country’s college education rate. And the left vertex of the diamond extends to the left based on the country’s antidepressant usage. The extent to which the vertex extends depends on a linear scale between our min-observed value and max-observed value of the variable of interest in our dataset. As a guide to help readers, the inner circle represents the position of the min-observed value, the outer circle represents the position of the max-observed value, and the middle circle represents the midpoint between the min and max observed values. Each diamond is colored on the same scale as the map plots by the country’s happiness, this was omitted by the legend to reduce clutter and because the vast majority of readers will have understood our color coding by the time they reach our last graph.

## The Story
If I told you happiness is closely related to GDP per capita, the result seems so obvious and uninteresting that a research project to show it would prove only to be pedantic and underwhelming. For that reason, we investigated more contentious or unusual datasets. 

News of Congress debating Obamacare and other nations evaluating their public health policies drove us to investigate government health expenditure in an attempt to seek deeper insights. Ideological clashes between democratic and authoritarian regimes pushed us to look at whether or not happiness is dependent on regime honesty. In these aspects, we found our results tend to be consistent with Western democratic-socialist ideals where increases in government spending and low levels of corruption are important correlators with citizen happiness. 

A result we found particularly interesting was the correlation of the education of a country’s older populace with the country’s overall current happiness. We believe that this can be interpreted such that having a well-educated older population that pioneered and built the current state of the country is important to the current happiness of the country. We found this interesting because this could be taken to argue that an investment in education today is key to obtaining happiness in future generations.

Finally, a shocking result we found was countries that are happier consume more antidepressants. Could it be that the “happiness” we’ve thus far observed is a mere illusion created through chemicals and medication? Or is it instead a coincidence of correlation, such that antidepressant usage is well-correlated with another variable, such as availability of mental health treatment, which is in turn well-correlated with happiness? 

The relationship presented with our last variable brings us to our concluding thoughts. As interesting as it may be to discover causation, this project is limited in merely showing correlation. While it may be that happiness is actually dependent on government healthcare spending, bureaucratic honesty, college-level education, and antidepressant usage, it may be that these are just traits commonly shown by happy countries and a result of another variable we have yet to discover. Nevertheless, our datasets did make for both a cool and impressive visualization, some flavorful and humorous quotes, and a series of potentially impactful implications. We had a great deal of fun creating this project and we hope you enjoy reading through it as much as we did.
